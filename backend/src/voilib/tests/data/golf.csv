0.0|2.84| Hi everybody, Andy here and just jumping on.
2.84|5.76| Me and Pierce are currently in Dundee,
5.76|9.96| who've just been to the practice day Monday at St Andrews.
9.96|12.36| And my voice is going a little bit for a lot of us.
12.36|13.96| We're doing a lot of talking today,
13.96|14.8| being on the golf course
14.8|16.92| and then actually we've just been interviewing
16.92|18.72| some of the players who are going out this week
18.72|21.36| and competing in the open.
21.36|22.88| And what we thought we did after we interviewed,
22.88|24.12| we said, I say, well, let's,
24.12|25.88| why don't we put these together
25.88|29.44| and actually just use them as a podcast.
29.44|31.68| So today what we thought we'd bring to you
31.68|35.24| is a chat that we had with current open champion,
35.24|36.4| Colin Moricala.
36.4|38.400000000000006| We just talked to him about his game, about this week,
38.400000000000006|40.760000000000005| what he does for the open, what he expects.
40.760000000000005|41.6| And we thought we'd just share it
41.6|43.36| with you guys, nice interesting chat, Pierce,
43.36|48.36| from just a real smart, great guy, Colin, isn't he?
48.8|50.92| He's very articulate in his answers.
50.92|54.0| He's very, he's a very intelligent golfer.
54.0|56.72| You can get that strategically on the golf course.
56.72|58.52| He is really good.
58.52|60.84| And just a really nice guy.
60.84|64.64| And we were at Eddard's open house, as you say, big party.
64.64|66.72| Luckily we had the full room in this,
66.72|68.64| in this, we were probably 20 people in this room
68.64|71.08| listening to me and you asking these questions.
71.08|73.24000000000001| And he answered them all really well.
73.24000000000001|74.88| And I think you're gonna get some good value out of this.
74.88|77.68| You'll understand a little bit more about him.
77.68|79.96000000000001| You'll understand about the open this week,
79.96000000000001|82.80000000000001| but also you'll understand how you can actually help your game
82.80000000000001|84.36| by just listening to some of the key things
84.36|85.2| he was talking about.
85.2|86.04| So definitely.
86.04|86.88| So are you sure on this one?
86.88|87.72| Are you sure on this?
87.72|88.56| Enjoy.
88.56|90.52| We might do a few of those over the next few days,
90.52|92.48| a bit of an open week special on the podcast.
92.48|95.67999999999999| So enjoy guys, please welcome Colin Moracau.
95.67999999999999|96.52| Thank you.
96.52|98.16| I still go back to our video that we played
98.16|99.48| at the...
99.48|100.32| Yeah.
100.32|101.96| The routine photo shoot.
101.96|102.8| Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
102.8|104.64| That was one of my best shots on a pressure plate.
104.64|105.48| Yeah.
105.48|106.56| You hit the ball good.
106.56|107.56| Like every one of them was good.
107.56|108.48| We couldn't get any of you anywhere near you.
108.48|109.4| Yeah, it's like stiffed it.
109.4|110.24| That's it.
110.24|111.08| It was the best video.
111.08|111.92| Best one.
111.92|114.28| So just a few questions then really, Colin.
114.28|117.0| This week, Open Champion, shit.
117.0|118.76| What is it that you do different,
118.76|119.6| leading up to a,
119.6|120.72| I mean, do you do anything different,
120.72|123.32| leading up to an Open Championship or a major?
123.32|125.08| What shots do you practice, work on,
125.08|127.48| if you've done anything specific for this week?
128.56|129.84| Obviously last year, you know,
129.84|132.32| I had success being at my first open,
132.32|135.16| but it only happened because I played the Scottish Open
135.16|136.04| the week before.
137.12|140.12| You guys know the ground's a lot firmer out here.
140.12|140.96| It's a lot drier.
140.96|141.92000000000002| The grass is different.
141.92000000000002|143.92000000000002| You have that kind of fescue grass.
143.92000000000002|146.0| And you want an iron that,
146.0|148.0| and obviously ball striking is kind of
148.0|150.44| what I've been known for the past few years.
150.44|152.52| I just wasn't finding center face.
152.52|154.72| And you wanted to find a club that was able to
154.72|157.84| go through the turf and be able to find center face
157.84|159.44| without changing your swing.
159.44|161.92| So I made that risk, made that adjustment
161.92|163.36| earlier on last year.
163.36|166.24| This year, put the clubs in the back of the bag,
166.24|170.76| seamless transition and haven't had to think about it twice.
170.76|174.4| But I'd say prep-wise, nothing crazy different.
174.4|178.8| I think the biggest thing is trying to play your game
178.8|180.76000000000002| rather than listen to other people and listen to,
180.76000000000002|182.24| this is how you need to play links golf.
182.24|183.72| This is what you need to do.
183.72|185.56| Links golf already makes you creative,
185.56|187.88| more creative than you're gonna be sometimes on,
187.88|190.64000000000001| you know, standard course we play in the US.
191.56|193.44| But it doesn't mean you need to start playing
193.44|194.28| different shots.
194.28|195.56| You just need to play to your strengths
195.56|197.92000000000002| and find a way to win.
197.92000000000002|199.64000000000001| You mentioned that, I think last time I spoke to you,
199.64000000000001|201.6| you mentioned one of the things that you always focus on
201.6|204.88| of course is just going back to FB creative.
204.88|206.12| That's just not think.
206.12|209.2| So when you are faced with the links challenge,
209.2|211.51999999999998| technique for you, does it just completely go
211.51999999999998|212.72| and you just start seeing the shots
212.72|214.48| and feeling the shots, is it all about that?
214.48|216.72| Yeah, I think that's what happens is like, you know,
216.72|219.12| we go back into being kids, right?
219.12|220.95999999999998| Of like, hey, hit it under this tree
220.95999999999998|225.28| or hit it around, you know, this bunker and bring it back.
225.28|226.92| Like that's what links golf is gonna make you do
226.92|228.92| because you have to be able to work the ball
228.92|229.88| and move the ball.
229.88|233.92| Obviously, weather is gonna make that heavily dependent
233.92|235.84| on what you're gonna decide to do.
235.84|238.68| But just thinking and knowing where the bunkers
238.68|243.0| are gonna be and where certain pin locations are gonna be.
243.0|245.16| I mean, you've got to have full controller golf ball
245.16|248.92| and as simple as it can be is being creative
248.92|250.92| and working the ball there.
250.92|253.28| You mentioned obviously the elements, the weather.
253.28|255.12| I'm not sure how much wind we're gonna get this week.
255.12|257.36| Maybe not as much as they normally get.
257.36|259.6| Seems like I'm having, I know you guys
259.6|261.28000000000003| want more, I want more too.
261.28000000000003|262.6| Pump it up a bit.
262.6|264.32000000000005| So this is just a real good question
264.32000000000005|266.6| for the people watching this who are gonna watch this now.
266.6|269.32000000000005| What are three tips that you would use
269.32000000000005|271.88| that they can use as well when playing in the wind?
271.88|274.84000000000003| Yeah, something I've been doing actually the past
274.84000000000003|278.64000000000004| probably two weeks even since I've been over here in Europe
278.64000000000004|280.40000000000003| is just thinking of windows, right?
280.40000000000003|283.04| We think about so much about technique
283.04|285.36| on teaching someone how to hit the ball low.
285.36|286.92| Obviously you wanna hit the ball low in the wind.
286.92|290.52000000000004| You wanna control the spin, spins the number one thing.
290.52000000000004|293.40000000000003| But if you can see your window where you wanna hit it,
293.40000000000003|295.88| you're gonna kind of force your body to hopefully,
295.88|299.20000000000005| at least what we do, hopefully keep it in that window, right?
299.20000000000005|300.8| And then if you don't, you can learn from there
300.8|303.48| and maybe think about a technical way to hit it low.
303.48|307.36| But I think if you only think, hey, I need to do this,
308.36|309.84000000000003| the ball might go everywhere
309.84000000000003|311.48| and you're not gonna really realize
311.48|313.16| and think about how to hit a golf shot.
313.16|315.56| You're only gonna think about what's gonna look good
315.56|319.32| and maybe this is how one person does it versus the other.
319.32|320.24| That's the biggest thing.
320.24|324.12| So I would say number one, see your shot, visualize it,
324.12|326.44| but also pick your window that you wanna hit it out of, right?
326.44|329.6| Low, medium, high, left, right, whatever.
329.6|334.08| I'd say the second thing is always take more club.
334.08|337.2| I think anytime you try and take the lesser club
337.2|339.4| and you try and hit it harder and hit it down,
339.4|340.64| it's gonna spin more.
340.64|342.28| You're gonna lose control of the ball.
342.28|344.64| Swing easy, keep it flat.
344.64|347.8| And the reason why, I mean, we do that is spin control.
347.8|351.84| So there's obviously, we understand why people do
351.84|353.47999999999996| and people say take more club.
354.56|358.08| And the third thing is sometimes,
358.08|361.03999999999996| just embrace it and don't fight the wind, right?
361.03999999999996|363.84| If it's hard off your left, don't try and hit a draw.
363.84|365.28| Sometimes just play with it for,
365.28|366.68| I think your normal amateur.
366.68|369.56| I think it's too hard and too much to think about
369.56|372.76| for them to try and draw it up into a left to right wind
372.76|376.71999999999997| or faded into a right to left, just aim far the left
376.71999999999997|378.32| and let it fall back.
378.32|379.88| I would say that aim further left
379.88|381.92| because I think that generally don't aim far enough left
381.92|384.03999999999996| or far enough right, but yeah, look at that.
384.03999999999996|386.15999999999997| So in terms of strategy, let's say this week
386.15999999999997|388.8| and just in general, I think one of the issues
388.8|390.15999999999997| that we're seeing with the average golfer
390.15999999999997|392.2| is they tend to just flag everything.
392.2|394.64| And they actually think that you guys on tour
394.64|396.2| just go through everything.
396.2|399.03999999999996| How many flags in a round do you think
399.03999999999996|401.44| you're actually going for?
401.44|402.28| On purpose.
402.28|403.11999999999995| On purpose.
405.32|406.15999999999997| Not that many.
406.15999999999997|408.59999999999997| I mean, maybe three.
408.59999999999997|409.71999999999997| Maybe, right?
409.71999999999997|412.64| And normally that's when you have a wedge in your hand.
414.11999999999995|417.28| Look, at the end of the day, what separates us from,
417.28|419.35999999999996| you know, the average golfer is that just our misses.
419.35999999999996|421.84| Like our misses tend to work out better,
421.84|423.88| but it's because we're not aiming at pins.
423.88|426.96| It's because we're aiming, we know where to miss the ball.
426.96|430.03999999999996| And thankfully our misses sometimes go to those places
430.04|432.52000000000004| and they look like good shots, right?
432.52000000000004|434.36| 20 feet away.
434.36|435.48| But we just take advantage of those.
435.48|438.6| I mean, we just keep compounding those good misses
438.6|442.08000000000004| and good decisions throughout the entire round.
442.08000000000004|446.52000000000004| And sometimes one bad decision of going at a pin
446.52000000000004|447.72| could cost you a tournament.
447.72|450.92| And that's just, you know, at our level, it's not acceptable.
450.92|453.68| But even at an amateur level, you know,
453.68|456.12| just because our balls look like they're getting close,
456.12|457.32000000000005| we're doing so many other things.
457.32000000000005|458.72| I mean, we're thinking about angles.
458.72|462.6| We're thinking about missing, about where to miss it.
462.6|464.04| You know, we're playing to our strengths, right?
464.04|468.12| So for them, never aiming at the pin.
468.12|469.56| Never.
469.56|471.36| That's exactly what they want to hear.
471.36|472.40000000000003| Yeah.
472.40000000000003|473.32000000000005| I love that.
473.32000000000005|476.8| And it's an interesting one for you this week, obviously.
476.8|480.76000000000005| You've got a 100% record here in this championship.
480.76000000000005|484.16| And obviously you closed out fantastically last year.
484.16|486.08000000000004| What would you say to the average golfer
486.08|488.76| who's obviously maybe not trying to win an open championship,
488.76|490.47999999999996| but they are trying to shoot their best score.
490.47999999999996|492.24| You know, they've got six holes left.
492.24|493.32| They're on for their best score.
493.32|496.15999999999997| They're probably counted every score up to that point.
496.15999999999997|498.88| What's a good tip for them to help them close out
498.88|499.88| that good round?
499.88|501.24| Set many goals, right?
501.24|504.08| Set smaller goals to get to that final hole.
504.08|506.96| Because I think what happens is whether you make the turn
506.96|511.28| or you have five holes left, you immediately think about the finish.
511.28|513.88| And that's the last thing and the worst thing you can think about
513.88|515.76| because then you're just going to rush
515.76|518.84| and you're going to just try and get to that finish line.
518.84|521.48| But if you set a small goal of, you know,
521.48|524.4399999999999| hey, maybe you are beating your best score by five shots.
524.4399999999999|526.92| And if you just are one over in the next three holes
526.92|529.52| and then one over in the next last three,
529.52|532.3199999999999| then you're still beating your best score by three shots, right?
532.3199999999999|535.24| So set smaller goals to make you stay in the present
535.24|538.68| and make you think about, OK, you know, let's not think about,
538.68|541.0| oh man, the what ifs and all that.
541.0|541.8| It's bad.
541.8|543.48| Yeah, good way of doing it.
543.48|544.84| And one final question then.
544.84|547.6800000000001| We're on a mission to try and grow the game and get more people.
547.6800000000001|549.5600000000001| We're really excited about a new project,
549.5600000000001|551.08| call mission to a million,
551.08|554.44| trying to get a million golfers into the game in the next five years.
554.44|556.6800000000001| What would be the best three bits of advice
556.6800000000001|560.24| you'd give to like a complete beginner getting into the game?
560.24|562.2| Advice, have fun.
562.2|564.88| I mean, tee up a driver and see how far you can hit it.
564.88|569.6| Go try and make the hardest part, compete against your friends.
569.6|572.96| Just have fun with whoever wants to go play golf with you.
572.96|576.6| I think everyone, you know, golf is such an individual sport,
576.6|579.44| but we play it with so many different people, right?
579.44|583.12| We have that opportunity to go out there and and tee it up against you guys,
583.12|587.0400000000001| against professionals, against amateurs, against juniors, anyone, right?
587.0400000000001|589.8000000000001| And I think we think of it as such a lonely sport,
589.8000000000001|593.44| but realistically, like if you go out and maybe you ask a group
593.44|596.96| if you can join or someone like people want that, right?
596.96|599.96| People want to go see other people play golf and see their shots.
599.96|602.9200000000001| And it's a very welcoming game.
602.9200000000001|607.0400000000001| I think people just shouldn't be as intimidated or shouldn't be as scared
607.0400000000001|611.1600000000001| to to go out and ask, like, hey, like you want to go play.
611.1600000000001|615.84| But do everything that we love to do that sometimes it makes us like
615.84|617.4000000000001| that's not what we end up doing, right?
617.4000000000001|619.76| We don't go out there and swing the driver as hard as we can.
619.76|623.36| We don't go out and, you know, do stupid things on the golf course.
623.36|624.96| But that's what we did growing up.
624.96|627.32| So I think that's what someone who's never played
627.32|631.2| can somehow get into and make it a little more fun, right?
631.2|635.44| And who knows, like, why can't golf be like that normally?
635.44|638.5600000000001| And just what we do as professionals and people that want to take it
638.5600000000001|641.36| on another level, you know, play golf for what it is
641.36|644.36| and what it has been, you know, in the past.
645.36|646.7600000000001| We definitely do some stupid stuff.
646.7600000000001|649.08| Yeah, exactly.
649.08|651.2| Oh, exactly. I think we all want to have fun, right?
651.2|653.2800000000001| And that's that's what's fun.
653.2800000000001|654.5600000000001| Client, have an amazing week.
654.5600000000001|656.2| It's going to be a fantastic tournament.
656.2|658.8000000000001| We know it is and hopefully you'll be up there on the leaderboard
658.8000000000001|661.0| in the last day and have a great week.
661.0|662.12| Thank you guys for it.
662.12|687.44| See you next time.
